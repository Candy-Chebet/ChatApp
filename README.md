*Fernet encryption algorithm*
/n
This app uses Fernet encryption algorithm, a high-level symmetric encryption scheme that leverages AES as its underlying encryption method. 
Fernet offers automated key generation, secure key storage, and other features that streamline the encryption process, reducing the risk of human errors. 
Integration of the encryption and decryption code into the platform yielded promising results. User data stored in the system's administrative interface 
demonstrated the effectiveness of the Fernet algorithm in encrypting messages to a degree where even administrators cannot access users' sensitive 
information or the content of their messages. This research underscores the importance of implementing robust encryption mechanisms in information exchange 
platforms to safeguard user data and maintain privacy. The adoption of Fernet as a practical encryption solution highlights its effectiveness 
in achieving end-to-end security while minimizing the potential for human error in the encryption process.
